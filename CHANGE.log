Change log for curve.js
-----------------------

2.3.1

FIX: Made the extension more "bullet-proof" in case other extensions should happen to have the same name.
FIX: JSDoc return type fixed (Array -> Float32Array).
FIX: Minor touch-ups/improvements
ADD: Added two new file versions of the implementation - one pure function if you don't feel comfortable using
extensions, as well as a pure mathematical function to return a point
array for the spline without drawing anything (canvas not required with this version).

2.3

CHG: Using typed arrays also for resulting array (Float32)
CHG: Default segment value is now 25 instead of 20 (dynamic approach is being considered).
IMP: Speed improvements
FIX: Fixed double point entries in result array

2.2

IMP: Using typed arrays internally for cached tension values for speed improvement
REM: A left over and unnecessary console.log removed

2.1.1

FIX: When closed, length of close array was still reflecting total length internally resulting in empty entries
as the closed section is calculated separately.

2.1

ADD: New option: closed loop
FIX: End point wasn't properly considered

2.0

New re-release of smooth line. Original can be found here:

ADD: Optimized inner loop with a caching step
CHG: Removed redundant code
CHG: Cleaned up var declarations
CHG: Removed internal moveTo() to conform better to context behavior in general
